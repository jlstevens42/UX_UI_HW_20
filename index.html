          <p class="lead">The Happy Hippie Foundation, a nonprofit founded by singer and actress Miley Cyrus in 2014, rallies young people to engage in systematic change and fight injustices in our world, specifically focusing on LGBTQ+ youth, homeless youth, and other vulnerable populations. Through program areas like prevention, crisis response, support services, and public education, Happy Hippie advocates for at-risk and disproportionately affected populations, such as youth aging out of foster care, people living with HIV/AIDS, youth in conflict zones, and people affected by crisis situations.</p>

                    We developed a user research plan consisting of three main tasks to observe as the user navigates the site, noting pain points, areas of confusion, and any comments or questions. We chose to observe users interacting with the existing site to identify problem areas requiring the most improvements and help us understand how to most effectively enhance the user experience through our redesign. Each team member conducted two virtual 1x1 interviews after which we analyzed our collective findings.

                    Tasks:
                    
                    What is the purpose of this nonprofit organization?
                    
                    What do the donations benefit, and how would you make a donation on this website?
                    
                    In what ways can you connect with this organization?
                    
                    Key Takeaways:
                    
                    Participants felt the content did not clearly communicate what the organization does
                    
                    Participants felt skeptical of the organization and questioned its credibility due to the lack of information on community impact
                    
                    Participants expressed they would be hesitant or unwilling to make a donation because they could not establish trust
                    
                    Navigating the site caused confusion among participants who felt the sections were not clearly named or lacked the relevant information they expected
                    
                    Despite finding the bright colors and funky patterns fun and intriguing, participants felt this reinforced their concerns regarding the credibility and professionalism of the organization

                    After each team member conducted two user tests, we combined and organized our data from the interview process into four sections in order to synthesize our research and determine key areas of improvement based on user insights. The categories were as follows:

            <p class="lead">You can write here as much as During 1x1 user interviews and observations, we discovered that the website design lacks the credibility needed for users to trust and feel confident in making donations via the nonprofit. Therefore, we believe that users would be more inclined to donate and get involved if they trusted the website, and we might be able to help if we analyze and redesign the UI.We might do this by adding more detailed information to help users better understand the nonprofit and additional images to help users visualize the work performed. Doing this will help communicate the legitimacy of the organization and the importance of the mission, resulting in increased donation volume and broader community impact.</p>
            <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Problem</h1>

              <p class="card-text">Through heuristic evaluation and annotations, I analyzed the existing design for both mobile and desktop, noting heuristic usability issues, accessibility issues, and pain points noted during user testing. I also noted potential solutions to prepare for the redesign process.

                Key Takeaways:
                
                The hero section consists of a large, static image that lacks the organization's name and purpose. This important, highly-viewed space must set the tone for the website, thus it should be redesigned to more effectively engage users and communicate the essence of the organization.
                
                The information architecture currently requires users to scroll and dig through the page to find essential details about the organization. The call to action of the site is making a donation, which falls toward the middle of the page. The site should be reorganized to ensure the most important content is easily accessible and located at the top of the page.
                
                The existing navigation can be easily overlooked and the footer consists only of site terms and conditions that do not add value to users. The redesigned navigation should consist of a clear, easily recognizable header and footer to improve the usability.</p>

              <p class="card-text">During the research phase, we determined the website lacks sufficient information, therefore we needed to add more content and images to communicate Happy Hippie’s impact and establish credibility. 

                The original site is formatted as a single page. However, we decided to use a multi-page format for our redesign to make the increased volume of information more digestible and avoid overwhelming our users.
                
                We created a sitemap to organize the original and added content into clear groupings.</p>

            <p class="lead">We agreed to redesign the mobile website for Happy Hippie because we wanted to follow the mobile-first design approach in order to address the restrictions of the smaller screen and ensure an optimal experience for our users.</p>
            <p class="lead">Using Whimsical, I created low- and mid-fidelity wireframes involved in our persona Serena's user flow. I discussed the below designs with my team and agreed to use as the basis for future iterations, also incorporating aspects from another teammate's Donate and Get Involved wireframes. We decided to divide and conquer to complete the high-fidelity wireframes in Figma, on which we would perform user testing. I wanted to design the homepage, specifically to tackle the challenge of creating an animation for the hero section that effectively communicates Happy Hippie's mission and spirit, as noted as an opportunity for improvement in our heuristic evaluation and annotations section. Another weakness I wanted to address was the site navigation, so I redesigned the header and hamburger menu and added a footer. Additionally, one of my teammates experienced unforeseen time constraints, so I assumed responsibility for the Our Work section to keep our momentum moving. As user testing revealed major confusion surrounding the work performed by Happy Hippie and unwillingness to donate to an "untrustworthy" site, I added significantly more information and images to this page.</p>

                    I wanted to design the homepage, specifically to tackle the challenge of creating an animation for the hero section that effectively communicates Happy Hippie's mission and spirit, as noted as an opportunity for improvement in our heuristic evaluation and annotations section.
                    
                    Another weakness I wanted to address was the site navigation, so I redesigned the header and hamburger menu and added a footer.
                    
                    Additionally, one of my teammates experienced unforeseen time constraints, so I assumed responsibility for the Our Work section to keep our momentum moving. As user testing revealed major confusion surrounding the work performed by Happy Hippie and unwillingness to donate to an "untrustworthy" site, I added significantly more information and images to this page.

        <h1 class="display-4  section_font">FINAL THOUGHTS</h1>
        <p class="lead">As an avid support of the Happy Hippie Foundation and its inspiring mission, I felt above average pressure to succeed in this redesign. I wanted to stay true to the Happy Hippie voice that I admire even in making the more dramatic changes, and I believe we accomplished that goal in the mobile version. Next up: desktop!</p>
        <p class="lead font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Key Takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="lead">Pay close attention to negative space. Especially when incorporating such bold colors and patterns, negative space is essential for creating a clean, elevated design that does not overwhelm users.</li>
          <li class="lead">Consistency is key! I established color and text styles within Figma for the proposed color palette and typography prior to designing our high-fidelity wireframes. Using the set color and text styles when designing wireframes individually allowed for greater consistency overall and fewer changes needed to be made when comparing our wireframes as a group. In the future, I would also like to establish spacing guidelines to follow as a team to further streamline the process.</li>
          <li class="lead">More user testing would allow for more meaningful iterations. Due to the time constraints, we performed two rounds of user testing: one on the original site and one on our high-fidelity prototype. We would have greatly benefitted from testing our low-fidelity prototype to gain valuable user insight before beginning the time-consuming iteration process that brought us to our high-fidelity user testing phase.</li>
